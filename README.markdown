# Welcome to the albacore project.

albacore is a suite of Rake tasks to automate the process of building a .NET based system. It's like MSBuild or Nant... but without all the stabby-bracket xmlhell.

# NOTICE OF PROJECT MOVE

Albacore has officially been moved to a new Github Organization and repository. Please update your
forks and references to point to the new [Albacore/albacore](https://github.com/Albacore/albacore)
repository.

I (Derick Bailey) am no longer an active contributor to the Albacore project, and have handed it
over to a small group of community members that are actively reviving this
project and moving it forward.

## Moving Issues / Pull Requests

If you have an open issue / pull request in my repository, please get in
contact with the new organization through their issue list, and work with
them to get the issue or pull request in to the new repository.
